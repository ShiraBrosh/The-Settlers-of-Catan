3. **Building**: Use resources to build roads, settlements, cities, and buy development cards.
4. **Trading**: Trade resources with other players and the bank.
5. **Development Cards**: Use special cards for advantages like moving the robber or gaining resources.
6. **Victory Points**: First player to reach 10 victory points wins.
